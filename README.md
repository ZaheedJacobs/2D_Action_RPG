# Installation Guide

1. Open a terminal at the project location. In VSCode, go to the top where it says Terminal, and click New Terminal. If you don't see terminal, you may see three dots near the top left, click those and see if Terminal is under those.

2. Activate the virtual environment. On MacOS, Linux and Unix, run `source venv/bin/activate`. On Windows, run `venv/Scripts/activate`. Note that if the `venv` folder does not exist, then you must create the virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv venv` (On Windows, the command is `python -m venv venv`)

3. Install Pygame by typing `pip install pygame`. Also make sure Pytmx is installed by typing `pip install pytmx`

4. Run the game by typing `python3 game.py`. If this doesn't succeed, try `python game.py`.
